                    <p>I'm Riley the coder, welcome to my github page! So a little about me, I am a 20 year old computer enthusiast. When I was just 16 a begged my father to buy me all the parts to build a computer and with little trial and error I put together my first computer ever. While it may not be the prettiest or may have a glass jar holding up the GPU, IT WORKED! Then and there started my addiction to not only computers but video games, animation, 3D & 2D art, programming, video editing and a lot more.<p>
